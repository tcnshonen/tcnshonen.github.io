## Music
- I play guitar, bass, piano and durms. I used to be the guitarist of a  band called Nein or Gas Mus (it's German) and here is the song we recorded.

## Games
During my undergraduate years I have worked on a small number of game projects.
- [Writer's Block](https://www.alphabetagamer.com/writers-block-alpha-demo/)
  - A creepy and surreal point and click survival horror adventure in which jealousy rears its ugly head (literally) as your mental state manifests into nightmares and monsters.
- [Don't Yell at Me, I'm Trying to Keep Us Alive](https://sammys.soe.ucsc.edu/2017/awards)
  - An asymmetrical Co-op VR game. Two players need to work together to complete three levels.
- [Blank](https://htsimsss.itch.io/blank)
  - A point and click puzzle game which focuses on the struggle of an Alzheimer's patient.
- [We and the Maze](https://htsimsss.itch.io/we-and-the-maze)
  - A personal project that extends the PICO8 engine to enable online chat.
