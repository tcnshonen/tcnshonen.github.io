I am currently a research engineer at [Kooick](https://www.kooick.ai/), where I focus on object segmentation and few-shot object detection. Aside from my full-time job, I am also working with [Prof. Yann Lecun](http://yann.lecun.com/) and [Prof. Alfredo Canzianiâ€¬](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfredocanziani/) on architectural energy-based models for self-supervised learning and motion prediction for autonomous vehicles.

Previously I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from New York University. During my time at NYU, I have worked with [Prof. Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) on visual representation evaluation and with [Prof. Rob Fergus](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/pmwiki/pmwiki.php)' Ph.D. students on multi-agent reinforcement learning in sequential social dilemmas.

Prior to NYU, I received my bachelor's degree with honors in Computer Science: Computer Game Design from University of California Santa Cruz back in June 2017 and worked as a junior specialist under the advisement of [Prof. Adam Smith](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/amsmith) for about 10 months.

I'm interested in machine learning and computer vision, more specifically representation learning, self-supervised learning and utilizing the temporal structure of videos to empower intelligence machines.
