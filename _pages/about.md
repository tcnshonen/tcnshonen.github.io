I am a second-year Computer Science Master's student at New York University.
I am currently working with [Prof. Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) on visual representation evaluation.
I also worked with [Prof. Rob Fergus](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/pmwiki/pmwiki.php)' Ph.D. student on multi-agent reinforcement learning in sequential social dilemmas.
Prior to NYU, I received my bachelor's degree with honors in Computer Science: Computer Game Design from University of California Santa Cruz back in June 2017 and worked as a junior specialist under the advisement of [Prof. Adam Smith](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/amsmith) for about 10 months.
I also spent a year at The University of Hong Kong as an exchange student.

I'm broadly interested in machine learning, the intersection between computer vision and natural language processing, and human computer interaction.
My previous research involves representation learning and deep learning for information retrieval.
