During my undergraduate years I have worked on a small number of game projects.
- [Writer's Block](https://www.alphabetagamer.com/writers-block-alpha-demo/)<br/>
  A creepy and surreal point and click survival horror adventure in which jealousy rears its ugly head (literally) as your mental state manifests into nightmares and monsters.<br/>

- [Don't Yell at Me, I'm Trying to Keep Us Alive](https://sammys.soe.ucsc.edu/2017/awards)<br/>
  An asymmetrical Co-op VR game. Two players need to work together to complete three levels.<br/>

- [Blank](https://htsimsss.itch.io/blank)<br/>
  A point and click puzzle game which focuses on the struggle of an Alzheimer's patient.<br/>

- [We and the Maze](https://htsimsss.itch.io/we-and-the-maze)<br/>
  A personal project that extends the PICO8 engine to enable online chat.<br/>
