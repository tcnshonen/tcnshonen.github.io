## Abstract

<p style="text-align:justify">
Regulation of tobacco products is imminently evolving, given the rapidly changing landscape of tobacco products. Understanding public sentiment in response to changes is very important as authorities assess how to effectively protect population health. Social media systems are widely recognized to be useful for collecting data about human preferences, especially amongst youth who also are significant users of new tobacco products such as e-cigarettes. However, the population using social media and how it may be used over time present challenges in drawing conclusions from such opt-in and non-representative data sources. In this paper we apply quasi-experimental designs, which have been used previously in observational data such as social media, to assess the utility of using social media to understand public discourse around regulations. We use interrupted time series and natural experiment designs to understand how 1) tobacco flavor bans change public sentiment on tobacco products, and 2) the effect of taxation on e-cigarette sentiment. Given rapidly changing regulations on tobacco products, here we demonstrate that with careful study design, social media can be useful to assess public response to regulation at multiple geographic scales.
